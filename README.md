# Dice_Roll
A simple Python script that will "roll" any number of any sided die that the user inputs. For use with games such as DnD and any tabletop dice game.

Since I only wanted it to accept valid dice and there aren't many of those, I have seperate statements for each number of sides rather than having one statement with a random.randing(0,sides) style input. 

The future plans with this code include interfacing with an arduino and creating a small box with a screen that can act as a tabletop digital dice roller. This could be placed near the players and be used to digitally roll dice if the physical dice are missing or not prefered.
