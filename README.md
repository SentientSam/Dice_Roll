# Dice_Roll
A simple Python script that will "roll" any number of any sided die that the user inputs. For use with games such as DnD and any tabletop dice game.


The future plans with this code include interfacing with an arduino and creating a small box with a screen that can act as a tabletop digital dice roller. This could be placed near the players and be used to digitally roll dice if the physical dice are missing or not prefered.
